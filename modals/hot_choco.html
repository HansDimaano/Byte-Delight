                <ul>
                    <li>Dry Milk Powder: Nonfat or whole milk - your call!</li>
                    <li>Cocoa Powder: Use natural and unsweetened cocoa powder. This way, you have complete control over the amount of sugar added.</li>
                    <li>Sugar: Since this recipe calls for unsweetened cocoa powder, sugar is a must. I use granulated sugar and much prefer it to powdered sugar.</li>
                    <li>Salt: A small pinch of salt will enhance the chocolate flavor big-time.</li>

                <u>How to Make Hot Chocolate</u>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Combine Ingredients: Whisk all of the ingredients together in a medium-sized bowl.</li>
                <li>Store: Store the mix in an airtight container or jar.</li>
                <li>Make Hot Chocolate: When you're ready to make a cup of hot cocoa, mix 2-3 tablespoons of the hot chocolate mix with 8 ounces of hot water or milk in a mug. Serve with mini marshmallows or other toppings of choice.</li>
            </ul>

                <u>Tips for Success</u><br>

                Before you combine any ingredients, take a look at these quick tips and suggestions. 
                They'll guide you toward your ideal hot cocoa!
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>For Maximum Creaminess: Go for whole milk powder rather than nonfat milk powder if you like a creamier hot cocoa. Because it contains fat, whole milk powder will naturally add a little more creaminess.</li>
                <li>Don't Add Extra Chocolate: I tried adding chopped chocolate to the mix and wasn't crazy about it. Even when chopped quite small, it didn't melt super well, nor did it seem to add much additional flavor.</li>
                <li>Use Granulated Sugar: I encourage you to stick with regular granulated sugar. Powdered sugar won't provide the same amount of sweetness.</li>
                <li>Don't Omit the Salt: Please don't forget the salt! Salt can so easily be overlooked, but it really does enhance the flavor of everything - even hot chocolate.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <u>Hot Cocoa Variations</u><br>

                Need a specific kind of hot cocoa to satisfy your craving? I've got you covered!
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Peppermint Hot Chocolate: Adding crushed peppermint to your hot chocolate mix makes it look and taste more festive! The bits of mint will melt in the hot cocoa and infuse it with peppermint flavor.</li>
                <li>Spiced Hot Cocoa: I often like to add some warm spices to my hot chocolate, especially during the fall. You can use cinnamon, clove, nutmeg or a combination!</li>
                <li>Drinking Chocolate: If you want to make a richer, more intense drinking chocolate rather than classic hot cocoa, simply replace about half of the sugar with unsweetened cocoa powder.</li>
                <li>Mexican Hot Chocolate: A lot of people prefer a certain amount of spiciness in their hot cocoa. If this applies to you, go ahead and add in some cayenne pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Mocha Hot Cocoa: Feel free to toss in a scoop of espresso powder if you'd like a mocha flavored hot chocolate. Use decaf espresso powder if desired.</li>
                <li>Spiked: I'm a big fan of some Irish cream in my hot chocolate for a fun twist. You could even try some Kahlua.</li>
            </ul>
